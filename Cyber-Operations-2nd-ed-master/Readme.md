This is a collection of scripts and programs that are included in the book
Cyber Operations (2nd ed) by Mike O'Leary.

These scripts and programs are provided for the convenience of the reader so that
he or she can replicate the examples in the text without having to re-type them. 

These scripts and programs are not designed for production use, rather they are
examples of the concepts explained in the text. In nearly every case, they will need
to be modified or customized to the reader's environment before they will run.
